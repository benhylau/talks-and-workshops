# Workshop: Building the Peer-to-Peer Internet

Participants will learn about community networks, wireless mesh networks, distributed applications, and train their pet Raspberry Pi to do networking things. This is a hands-on session where participants will use IPFS and Secure Scuttlebutt on a mesh network of Raspberry Pis, then perhaps become future facilitators of this open-source workshop.

Propose to run Module 1 at dweb. It requires a big TV or projector, power outlets and participants (up to 10) need only laptops. There are three parts over 1.5 - 2 hours:

Intro (15 min)
Hands-on Activity (40 min)
Discussion (20 min)

A website is currently under development, and is designed for facilitators (whether from a technical background or not) to to modify the workshop and students to self-guide or review. All previous iterations have been as pilots, perhaps we can make a blog post on the dweb blog to announce this open-source curriculum as output?

People involved in this project are listed on the course GitHub. Also, some of the current work on this is support by a SSBC grant:
