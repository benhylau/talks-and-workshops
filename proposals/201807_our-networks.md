# Peer-to-peer Applications On A Mesh Network

## Description

In this session, I will present [Mesh Orange](https://github.com/tomeshnet/mesh-orange), a Debian-based router that runs on various single-board computers (SBCs), which together form an autonomous encrypted mesh network. The operating system supports various WiFi hardware and features a configuration system that allows local mesh communities to specify custom hardware settings. After walking through the steps to form a physical mesh network with Mesh Orange, we will run peer-to-peer applications on these SBCs to show a possible internet where networked applications are serviced by distributed protocols communicating over physical nodes arranged in a mesh topology.

Type: demo
Length: 1 hour
Additional considerations: n/a

## Session Objective

- Present Mesh Orange as a viable operating system to build mesh nodes on SBCs
- Show how to build and work with Mesh Orange
- Demo a decentralized internet serviced by peer-to-peer application protocols over a physical mesh network
